# SalesEngineer
 Standalone app designed by me using JavaFX and JavaMail API for sales support for teams up to 20 members. The main goal is, that user can click buttons for describe whole phone conversation with the customer, which takes a much less time, than type everything manually and allows user to focus on listening the customer.
